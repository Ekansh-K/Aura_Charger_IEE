    "# Creating and understanding the features of the model and the Characteristics of the Dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "- This project aims to Create a USB charger with an RGB wire that displays charge levels based on color.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ML model will be used to predict the lifespan, battery condition, replacement needed or not, and charging time of the battery overtime.\n",
    "---\n",
    "The model will be trained on the battery's charging and discharging data. \"How long is the battery taking to get full?\" How frequently is the battery being charged? What is the maximum temperature during charging? What is the rate of charge and discharge? What is the error factor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be collected everytime you plug in charge, and when you remove the charger, the stats collected can be the entries for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameters: Battery Type, Time taken to full charge, Max Temp during charging, Rate of Charge, Rate of discharge, correction Factor.\n",
    "- Outputs: Battery Life, Replacement needed or not, New Predicted Total Charging time .\n",
    " \n",
    "Lets look into each parameter:\n",
    "- Battery type: depending on the battery type, the formula can be different. For example, a lithium-ion battery charges differently than a nickel-cadmium battery.\n",
    "- Time taken to full charge: This can be a good indicator of the battery's health. If the battery is taking longer to charge, it could be a sign that the battery is aging.\n",
    "- Max Temp during charging: A higher temperature generally leads to a shorter battery life. Higher temp can also tell us about discharghing, which is also a factor.\n",
    "- Rate of Charge: Aged batteries have a slower rate of charge than new batteries because they have a lower capacity and a longer trailing edge\n",
    "- Rate of discharge: Aged batteries have a slower rate of discharge than new batteries because they have a lower capacity and a longer trailing edge.\n",
    "- Correction Factor: Larger the correction factor, more the battery is aged.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to consider factors like Battery type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a battery ages and its life decreases, the time it takes to charge typically increases.\n",
    "- A higher temperature generally leads to a shorter battery life.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> relation with battery life and temperature.\n",
    "charging temps do matter. as a matter of fact, more temp can be bad for the battery and lead to lesser life.\n",
    "we can do it this way: keep a points system. if the battery temp for almost 5 charges is too high than a \"threshold\" temperature, then point can be added. and if the points exceed a certain limit, then the battery is considered to be in bad condition, or we can say it has impacted the life of the battery.\n"
